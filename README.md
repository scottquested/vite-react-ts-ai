## Installation

To get started with this demo project, you will need to clone the repository and install the dependencies:

git clone https://github.com/scottquested/vite-react-ts-ai.git
cd vite-react-ts-ai
npm install
```

## Usage

To start the development server, run the following command:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will start a development server at http://localhost:5173/vite-react-ts-ai/ where you can view the demo.

## Configuration

This demo project requires an API key from OpenAI to work. You can get an API key by signing up for the OpenAI API and creating a new API key.

Once you have your API key, create a new .env file at the root of the project and add the following line:

```bash
VITE_OPEN_AI_KEY=your-api-key-goes-here
```

Make sure to replace your-api-key-goes-here with your actual API key.

## Technologies Used
